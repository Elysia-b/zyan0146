Welcome to Zombie Escape, a thrilling 2D survival puzzle game where quick decisions mean life or death. You play as a lone survivor, starting at the top-left corner of a walled 20x20 grid. Your objective? Make it to the exit ðŸšª in the bottom-right corner while evading relentless zombies ðŸ§Ÿ, collecting life-saving medkits ðŸ©¹, and dodging impassable walls ðŸ§±.

Each round, you must decide whether to move north, south, east, or westâ€”or use a medkit to regain health. But beware: zombies donâ€™t rest. They move toward you after every turn, and if they reach your position, theyâ€™ll bite, draining your health. Some recover and chase again, others stay momentarily stunned after biting.

Your journey is filled with strategic choices:

HP (Health Points): Starts at 3, and you lose one each time you get hit by a zombie.

Medkits: Heal one HP, but are limited in supplyâ€”use them wisely.

Zombies: Intelligent enemies that chase you down relentlessly. If you step into one, or it catches you, youâ€™ll take damage.

Walls: Block your path. Plan your route carefully.

Victory: Reach the exit tile ðŸšª without dying.
